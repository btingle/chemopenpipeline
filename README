~~~ THE UCSF DOCK DB2 BUILD PIPELINE : THE OPEN SOURCE C++ REVENGEANCE ~~~

Welcome! This is a streamlined and fully open-source C++ version of the UCSF DOCK DB2 build scripts.
Main Changes:
* Now using fully open source software!
* Much faster!
* The various interacting python and shell scripts from the original pipeline have been collectively integrated into a single C++ program
* With the exception of AMSOL, this program spawns no child processes and utilizes the minimum possible file I/O

Dependencies:
CDPKit    : substituting for OMEGA, RDKit, and ChemAxon CXCalc
OpenBabel : converts MOL2 to MOPACINT format for AMSOL
AMSOL	  : ancient fortran program doing what it has always done!
